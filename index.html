  <h1> Linux Mint </h1>

  <p> <strong>Linux Mint</strong> is a community-driven <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution"
      target="_blank">Linux distribution</a> based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu"
      target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> (which is in turn based on Debian), bundled with a variety of free and open-source
    applications. It can provide full out-of-the-box multimedia support for those who choose to include proprietary
    software such as multimedia codecs.
  </p>

  <p>The Linux Mint project was created by Clément Lefèbvre and is actively maintained by the Linux Mint Team and
    community.</p>

  <h2> Software by Linux Mint </h2>

  <h3> Cinnamon </h3>

  <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon_(desktop_environment)" target="_blank">Cinnamon</a> desktop
    environment
    is a fork of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Shell" target=_blank> GNOME Shell</a> based on the
    innovations made in Mint Gnome Shell Extensions (MGSE). It was released as an add-on for Linux Mint 12 and has been
    available as a default desktop environment since Linux Mint 13.</p>

  <h2>Installation</h2>

  <p> Linux Mint can be booted and run from a USB flash drive on any PC capable of booting from a USB drive, with the
    option of saving settings to the flash drive. A USB creator program is available to install on Ubuntu (but not LMDE)
    Live Linux Mint on a USB drive. Alternatively, the Linux Mint ISO can be burned to a DVD to boot from. </p>

  <h2> Editions </h2>

  <p>Linux Mint has multiple editions based on Ubuntu, with various <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment" target="_blank"> desktop environments</a> available. It
    also has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian" target="_blank"> Debian</a>-based edition.
  </p>

  <h3> Ubuntu-based editions </h3>

  <p>As of Linux Mint 13, there are two main editions developed by the core development team and using Ubuntu as a base.
    One includes Linux Mint's own Cinnamon as the desktop environment while the other uses <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATE_(software)" target="_blank"> MATE</a>. There is also a version with the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfce" target="_blank"> Xfce</a> desktop environment by default. Since the
    release of version 19 (Tara) in June 2018, the three editions are released simultaneously.

    Beginning with the release of Linux Mint 19, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE"
      target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE"> KDE</a> edition was officially discontinued; however, the KDE 17.x and
    18.x releases were supported until 2019 and 2021, respectively. Older releases, now also obsolete, included editions
    that featured the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME" target="_blank"> GNOME </a>, LXDE, and Fluxbox
    desktop environments by default.
  </p>

  <h3> LMDE </h3>

  <p>The Linux Mint Debian Edition <em>(LMDE)</em> uses Debian Stable as the software source base rather than Ubuntu.
    LMDE was originally based directly on Debian's Testing branch, but is designed to provide the same functionality and
    look and feel as the Ubuntu-based editions. LMDE has its own package repositories.

    LMDE claims certain advantages and disadvantages compared to 'Mint Main' (i.e., the Ubuntu-based editions):

    LMDE is faster and more responsive than Ubuntu-based editions.
    LMDE requires a deeper knowledge and experience with Linux and Debian package management.
    Debian is less user-friendly and desktop-ready than Ubuntu, with some rough edges.
